            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learnt were current,if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly felt i got every penny's worth.

            " I was an EMT for years before i joined the bootcamp.I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.The next 12 weeks was the best-and the most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've sucessfully switche carees, working as a software engenieer at VR startup."

           "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structures from proffesionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to join by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire Curriculum and staff did not dissapoint, they were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project in particular was outstanding,It took my learning process to the next level in a way no tutorial could ever have. Infact I've often refeered to it as an example of my development experience.It clearly enabled me land a job as a full stack developer, after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend."
